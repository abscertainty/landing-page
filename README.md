# landing-page

The last project in the Foundations Course in TOP before Javascript.
In this project I will be working on my Git skills (commits for the 
most part), and my Web page design skills. I will only be using flex-box 
for the design since this is what I've learned so far in the TOP course.

At the end of the project I will add in a list the new things I learn 
from this project.
